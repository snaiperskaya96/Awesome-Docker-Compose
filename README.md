# Awesome-Docker-Compose
Turns out I've got a lot of docker-compose.yml around and it's always a PITA to write them from scratch after you have done it around a thousand times already.

Usually I don't keep my personal repos on Github but I thought this might be useful also to the beautiful person who's reading this README as well, so, enjoy.
